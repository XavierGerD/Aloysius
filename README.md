After `npm install` in /Aloysius, run `npm start` in /Aloysius directory.

Aloysius is an online music education platform aimed at beginners and advanced students alike. It contains various lessons and interactive exercises on topics such as Rhythm, Harmony and Orchestration.

Using the SMuFL standard, I created a music viewer that displays musical scores using a JSON file that contains all information related to bars, chords, pithces, noteheads, beams and flags. This viewer is used in Aloysius to generate exercises in which, for example, the user must drag-and-drop the correct note value into a drop box.
